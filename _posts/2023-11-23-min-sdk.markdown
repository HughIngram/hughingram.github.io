## Introduction *

Increasing your minSdkVersion has many benefits blah blah *
It's a tradeoff, you lose some % of users *
Show the market breakdown graphic. Maybe show it by region too - highlight that it's different by region.

## Cleaning up your codebase

- Search your codebase for usages of `BUILD.VERSION_CODES`, `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT`, `@RequiresApi`, `@TargetApi`, and `tools:targetApi`, to check for spots where your code branches dependeding on sdk version. You may find many back-compatibility fixes which can be removed.
- Each section in the list below lists the cleanups which are enabled by an increast the respective minSdkVersion or higher.

## 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

- [`VectorDrawableCompat`][vector-back-compat] is supported from sdk 14 and up - you can replace your png files with vector assets.

## 19 (4.4 - 4.4.4 / KitKat)

- Make use of the latest AndroidX library versions after their minSdk was increased [from October 2023 onwards][androidx].

## 20

- It may be possible to remove `multidexEnabled = true` from the `android` block of `build.gradle`, in case this property was added for the sake of supporting [desugaring][desugaring].

## 21 (5.0 / Lollipop)

- TLS 1.2 is supported. In case you added a [workaround][tls-workaround] to support TLS on older android versions, it can be removed.
- You can use Jetpack Compose in your project

## 23 (6.0 / Marshmallow)

- TODO `android:foreground`

## 24 (7.0 / Nougat)

- Full support for vector drawable features, without using backwards compatibility:
    - You can remove `vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true` from your `build.gradle` file.
    - You can switch usages of `app:srcCompat` to `android:src`
- Support for resource references inside vector drawables (e.g. setting `fillColor="?attr/colorOnPrimary"``).

## 25 (7.1 / Nougat)

- todo

## 26 

- `android:focusedByDefault`
- Support for java APIs `java.time` is enabled - this means that you may no longer need to use a backwards compatibility solution for this API, e.g. [desugaring][desugaring] or [ThreeTen][threeten]
