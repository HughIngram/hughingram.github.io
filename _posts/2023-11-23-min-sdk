# What can you change when increasing your minSdkVersion? *

## Introduction *

Increasing your minSdkVersion has many benefits blah blah *
It's a tradeoff, you lose some % of users *
Show the market breakdown graphic. Maybe show it by region too - highlight that it's different by region.

## Cleaning up your codebase

- Search your codebase for usages of `SDK_INT` (i.e., usages of `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT`), to check for spots where your code branches dependeding on sdk version. You may find many back-compatibility fixes which can be removed.
- Each section in the list below lists the cleanups which are enabled by the respective minSdkVersion

## 19 (4.4 - 4.4.4 / KitKat)

- Make use of the latest AndroidX library versions [from October 2023 onwards][androidx]

## 21 (5.0 / )

## 23 (6.0 / Marshmallow)

test

## 24 (7.0)

<!-- TODO fact check this -->
- Full support for [vector drawable features][vector-back-compat] `fillColor`, `fillType` and `strokeColor`. With a min sdk level of 24, you can remove `vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true` from your build.gradle

<!-- this is pretty extensive, but I want to show how code can be cleaned up too -->
