# What can you change when increasing your minSdkVersion? *

## Introduction *

Increasing your minSdkVersion has many benefits blah blah *
It's a tradeoff, you lose some % of users *
Show the market breakdown graphic. Maybe show it by region too - highlight that it's different by region.

## Cleaning up your codebase

- Search your codebase for usages of `SDK_INT` (i.e., usages of `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT`), to check for spots where your code branches dependeding on sdk version. You may find many back-compatibility fixes which can be removed.
- Each section in the list below lists the cleanups which are enabled by the respective minSdkVersion

## 14

- [`VectorDrawableCompat`][vector-back-compat] is supported from sdk 14 and up - you can replace your png files with vector assets.

## 19 (4.4 - 4.4.4 / KitKat)

- Make use of the latest AndroidX library versions [from October 2023 onwards][androidx]

## 21 (5.0 / Lollipop)

<!-- todo fact check this-->
<!-- in the avocado app, it seems safe to remove this already in 21 -->
- Initial support for vector drawables, without back compatibility. With min sdk of 21, it is unlikely that you will be able to remove `vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true` from your `build.gradle`, since full support is not added until sdk level 24.
<!-- todo double check the inpage search icon on android 5 -->
- You can switch usages of `app:srcCompat` to `android:src`
- You can use Jetpack Compose in your project

## 23 (6.0 / Marshmallow)

test

## 24 (7.0)

<!-- TODO fact check this -->
- Full support for [vector drawable features][vector-back-compat] `fillColor`, `fillType` and `strokeColor`, as well as support for resource references (e.g. referring to a theme attribute inside a vector drawable), without using `VectorDrawableCompat`. 
With a min sdk level of 24, you can remove `vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true` from your build.gradle


<!-- 
notes:

with a minsdk of 24, it's safe to also replace srcCompat with src
for 21 also??
yeah... but search icon on android 5?
